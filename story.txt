I was at the Biergarten of Berlin today, drinking Weihenstephan Hefe Weissbier and eating a bratwurst before ich bin schlafen gegangen.
Shortly thereafter I was listening to my favorite musik while driving a Porsche to ratskeller of Berlin.
Which reminded me that during my last visit to Berlin I saw the lead vocalist of Rammstein at the flughafen. 
The vocalist had called me over in order to let me know that he loved my lederhose and wanted to buy them.
He generously offered me â‚¬5,000 and a ride in his custom Audi that he used in wettbewerbsfaehig racing, but I declined the offer by expressing that my lederhose were a priceless family heirloom handed down by my Oma.
Truth be told though, the real reason I did not get into the car was because of the Klimaanlage was not working and it was really hot.
